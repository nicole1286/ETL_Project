Happiness ETL

The purpose of this project is to explore whether happiness depends on economic freedom or the system of government in which one lives. We will review the happiness index and compare it to the economic freedom index for 2016. We will also compare vs countries and their stated system of government.

Data Cleanup & Analysis
Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:

Extract- from data sources (CSV's- Economic freedom index produced by The Heritage Foundation Happiness Index List of countries by government from Wikipedia)

Transformation- needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).

Load- The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.
