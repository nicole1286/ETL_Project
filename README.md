Happiness ETL

The purpose of this project is to explore whether happiness depends on economic freedom or the system of government in which one lives. We will review the happiness index and compare it to the economic freedom index for 2016. We will also compare vs countries and their stated system of government.

Sources of data: Economic freedom index produced by The Heritage Foundation Happiness Index List of countries by government from Wikipedia
